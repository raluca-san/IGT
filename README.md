# Repository for processing XML Log files from surgeries conducted with medical devices - data mining
- extracting information from XML Logs outputted from Imaged Guided Stereotactic Devices (tailored for the CAS-One IR Logs)
- statistical metrics for assessing the planning and validation of the tools (needles, ablation devices, etc)


The snippets package contains the following modules:
* `A_mainExtractTrajectories` -- 
* `B_parseNeedleTrajectories` -- 
* `C_NeedlesInfoClasses` -- 
* `D_extractIREAngles` -- 
* `extractTPEsXML` -- 
* `extractAreaNeedles` -- extract the areas formed by the coordinates in space of the needle target points
* `plot3DAngles` -- plot angles in 3D based on their 3D coordinates in space
